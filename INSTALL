The install process for GSRC is straight forward.

Grab the current package description files from the internet with "bzr checkout" or "brz checkout", (the python 3 version):

     $ bzr checkout bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/gsrc/trunk/ gsrc
        # (use "bzr checkout --lightweight" to download the latest revision only)

Then

     $ cd gsrc/
     $ ./bootstrap                       # to create the configure script
     $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/gnu    # --prefix is directory to install the compiled packages
                                         # Pick your --prefix by your wishes.

                                         # You can give `./configure' the normal GNU configure arguments.
					 # If you decide to change these, either reconfigure, 
					 # or edit `config.mk'.


     $ . ./setup.sh                      # This just sets some ENV variables and appends to PATH
                                         # and other variables to allow GSRC to work seamlessly.
                                         # Put this line in your .bashrc.
     $ make install                      # installs the "gsrc" command itself and info docs.

That is all that is necessary to set up the GSRC system. Everytime you wish to compile something in GSRC, first do


      $   bzr update            # to get all the latest changes to all packages
                                # ("brz" is python3 name)


      $  make help              # will provide some
