GARVERSION = 1.34

DESCRIPTION = Managing tar archives
define BLURB
Tar provides the ability to create tar archives, as well as the
ability to extract, update or list files in an existing archive.  It
is useful for combining many files into one larger file, while
maintaining directory structure and file information such as
permissions and creation/modification dates.  GNU tar offers many
extensions over the standard utility.
