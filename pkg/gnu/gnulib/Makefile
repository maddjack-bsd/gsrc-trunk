DESCRIPTION = Source files to share among other software projects
define BLURB
Gnulib is a central location for common infrastructure needed by
GNU packages.  It provides a wide variety of functionality, e.g.,
portability across many systems, working with Unicode strings,
cryptographic computation, and much more.  The code is intended to be
shared at the level of source files, rather than being a standalone
library that is distributed, built, and installed.  The included
"gnulib-tool" script helps with using Gnulib code in other packages.
Gnulib also includes copies of licensing and maintenance-related
files, for convenience.
