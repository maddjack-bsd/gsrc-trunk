GARVERSION = 2.0
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/nano-archimedes/
DESCRIPTION = Simulation of quantum systems using the Wigner Monte Carlo method
define BLURB
nano-archimedes is a free package for the simulation of quantum
systems.  It is based on the Wigner equation, a formulation of quantum
mechanics in terms of a phase-space which is mathematically equivalent
to the Schroedinger equation.  nano-archimedes implements the Wigner
Monte Carlo method.  The code can be easily extended to density
functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent ab-initio simulations.
