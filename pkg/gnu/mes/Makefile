DESCRIPTION = GNU Mes is a Scheme interpreter and C compiler for bootstrapping the GNU System
define BLURB
GNU Mes is a Scheme interpreter and C compiler for bootstrapping the GNU
System.  Since version 0.22 it has again helped to halve the size of
opaque, uninspectable binary seeds that are currently being used in the
Reduced Binary Seed bootstrap GNU Guix.  The final goal is to help
create a full source bootstrap as part of the "bootstrappable builds"
effort for UNIX-like operating systems.
