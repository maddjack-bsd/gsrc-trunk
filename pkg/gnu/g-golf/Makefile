NAME =  GNU G-Golf    
GARNAME = g-golf
GARVERSION =  0.1.0
HOME_URL =   https://www.gnu.org/software/g-golf
DESCRIPTION = GNU G-Golf is a Guile Object Library for GNOME.
define BLURB
G-Golf is a Guile Object Library for GNOME.  G-Golf low level API
comprises a binding to - (most of) the GObject Introspection and (some of)
the GObject and Glib libraries, as well as additional (G-Golf) utilities
- used to import GObject libraries and build their corresponding G-Golf
high level API.  Note: to be precise, G-Golf imports (and depends on the
existence of) a Typelib - a binary, readonly, memory-mappable database
containing reflective information about a GObject library.
