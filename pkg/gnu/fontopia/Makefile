DESCRIPTION = A console font editor
define BLURB
Fontopia is an easy-to-use, text-based, console font editor. It is used
to edit the fonts that GNU/Linux uses to display text on text-based terminals.
Fontopia works on both PSF 1 and 2, BDF, Code Paged (CP) fonts, and Raw font
files. It provides a user-friendly, easy-to-use glyph editor and it can
easily change font metrics (e.g. length, width, and height) and convert
between different font formats.
