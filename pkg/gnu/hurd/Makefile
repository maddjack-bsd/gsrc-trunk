DESCRIPTION = The kernel servers for the GNU operating system
define BLURB
The Hurd is the kernel for the GNU system, a replacement and
augmentation of standard Unix kernels.  It is a collection of
protocols for system interaction (file systems, networks,
authentication), and servers implementing them.  Subprojects include Mach,
the microkernel on which the Hurd is based, which provides a basic
inter-process communication mechanism, and MIG, an interface generator
for Mach.
