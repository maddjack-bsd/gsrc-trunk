NAME = Aris
GARNAME = aris
GARVERSION = 2.2
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/aris/
DESCRIPTION = Natural deduction first-order logic interface
define BLURB
Aris is a program for performing logical proofs.  It supports
propositional and predicate logic, as well as Boolean algebra and
arithmetical logic.  In addition to its predefined inference and
equivalence rules, Aris also supports references to older proofs.
Its use of standard logical symbols and its natural deduction
interface make it easy to use for beginners.
