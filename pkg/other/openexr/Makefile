NAME =    OpenEXR
GARNAME = openexr
GARVERSION = 3.0.5
HOME_URL = http://www.openexr.com
DESCRIPTION =  high dynamic-range (HDR) 2-d image file format
define BLURB
OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
Industrial Light and Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
Features: Higher dynamic range and color precision than existing 8- and
10-bit image file formats.  Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit
floating-point, and 32-bit integer pixels. The 16-bit floating-point
format, called "half". Multiple image compression algorithms, both
lossless and lossy.New compression codecs and image types can easily
be added by extending the C++ classes New image attributes (strings,
vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR applications.
Deep Data. Pixels can store a variable length list of samples. IlmImf, a
library that reads and writes OpenEXR images.
