DESCRIPTION = Integer Set Library  
define BLURB
isl is a library for manipulating sets and relations of integer points
bounded by linear constraints. Supported operations on sets include
intersection, union, set difference, emptiness check, convex hull,
(integer) affine hull, integer projection, and computing the lexicographic
minimum using parametric integer programming. It also includes an ILP
solver based on generalized basis reduction.
