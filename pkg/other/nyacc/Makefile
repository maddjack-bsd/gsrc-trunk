DESCRIPTION =  Guile modules for nyacc compiler creation and parsers
define BLURB
NYACC, for Not Yet Another Compiler Compiler, is set of guile modules for
generating parsers and lexical analyzers.  It also provides sample parsers
and pretty-printers using SXML trees as an intermediate representation.
It provides a decent C parser and a FFI Helper tool to help create
Guile Scheme bindings for C-based libraries.  It provides (partially
implemented) compilers based on above mentioned parsers to allow execution
with Guile as extension languages.
