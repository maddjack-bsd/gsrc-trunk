DESCRIPTION = low-level event loop management library  
define BLURB
Liboop is a low-level event loop management library for POSIX-based
operating systems. It supports the development of modular, multiplexed
applications which may respond to events from several sources. It replaces
the "select() loop" and allows the registration of event handlers for
file and network I/O, timers and signals.
