DESCRIPTION =  Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collector for C and C++
define BLURB 
The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector
can be used as a garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++
new. It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would,
without explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The
collector automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can
no longer be otherwise accessed.
