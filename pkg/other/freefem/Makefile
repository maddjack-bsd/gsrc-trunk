DESCRIPTION =  partial differential equation solver, finite element analysis
define BLURB
FreeFem is a partial differential equation solver. It has its own
language. freefem scripts can solve multiphysics non-linear systems in 2D
and 3D.  Problems involving PDE (2d, 3d) from several branches of physics
such as fluid-structure interactions require interpolations of data
on several meshes and their manipulation within one program. FreeFem
includes a fast 2^d-tree-based interpolation algorithm and a language
for the manipulation of data on multiple meshes (as a follow up of bamg,
now a part of FreeFem). Formerly called "FreeFEM++".
