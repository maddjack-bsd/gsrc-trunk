NAME =    Mercury
GARNAME = mercury
GARVERSION = 20.06.1
HOME_URL = http://www.mercurylang.org/
DESCRIPTION =  Mercury logic programming language 
define BLURB
Mercury is a pure logic programming language intended for the creation
of large, fast, reliable programs. The syntax of Mercury is based on the
syntax of Prolog, but semantically the two languages are very different
due to Mercury_s purity, its type, mode, determinism and module systems.
