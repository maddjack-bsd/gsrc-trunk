NAME =    guile-file-names
GARNAME = guile-file-names
GARVERSION =  0.2
HOME_URL = http://brandon.invergo.net
DESCRIPTION = file-name abstraction module for Guile 
define BLURB
The (file-names) module provides methods for manipulating file names
(aka file paths, but for GNU Coding Standards reasons, the module
does not refer to "paths").  The module was built based on the idea that
doing anything more than a non-trivial modification of a file name
string is a pain (making sure all slashes are present and accounted for,
resolving '.' and '..', etc).  Inevitably, you have to break the string
up into chunks and operate on that list of components.  This module
takes care of that for you.
