DESCRIPTION = Numerical study of dynamical systems.
define BLURB
Gnans is a program (and language) for the numerical study of deterministic
and stochastic dynamical systems. The dynamical systems may evolve in
continuous or discrete time.  Gnans loads a system, a definition of a
dynamical system in a special, equation oriented language. The description
consists of declarations of states etc, and equations describing the
dynamics of the system. As an advanced feature, arbitrary C++-code may
also be contained in the system description. Gnans sorts the equations,
translates them into C++, which is subsequently compiled and linked
into the running program. It is then able to solve the system equations
numerically with the speed of a compiled (as opposite to interpreted)
program.
