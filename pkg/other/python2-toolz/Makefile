DESCRIPTION = Utility functions for iterators, functions, dictionaries.
define BLURB
Toolz provides a set of utility functions for iterators, functions,
and dictionaries. These functions interoperate well and form the
building blocks of common data analytic operations. They extend the
standard libraries itertools and functools and borrow heavily from the
standard libraries of contemporary functional languages.
