DESCRIPTION = Simple Features Computational Geometry Algorithms Library 
define BLURB
SFCGAL is a C++ wrapper library around CGAL with the aim of supporting
ISO 19107:2013 and OGC Simple Features Access 1.2 for 3D operations.
SFCGAL provides standard compliant geometry types and operations,
that can be accessed from its C or C++ APIs. PostGIS uses the C API,
to expose some SFCGAL''s functions in spatial databases.
