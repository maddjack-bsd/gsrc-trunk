NAME = Dismal-mode
GARNAME = dismal
GARVERSION = 1.4
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/dismal/
DESCRIPTION = Emacs spreadsheet mode
define BLURB
Dismal implements a full spreadsheet mode in Emacs.  Because it is
within Emacs, Dismal benefits from all the functionality offered it.
It is fully extensible, allowing users to implement their own
functions.  It also has several novel features, such as the ability
to timestamp keyboard and mouse movement.
