NAME = songanizer
GARNAME = songanizer
GARVERSION = 1.0alpha
HOME_URL = http://www.gnu.org/software/
DESCRIPTION = songanizer
define BLURB
Songanizer is a shell script to organize a directory containing a collection
of Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files. The goal is to create virtual directory structures,
which give different views of the data, but without having redundant copies of
the files themselves.
