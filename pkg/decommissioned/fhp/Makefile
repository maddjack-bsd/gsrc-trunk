DESCRIPTION =  HTML page creation macros 
define BLURB
fhp is an easy language to create HTML pages.  First, you write a
stylesheet which contains the layout of the page, then you write some
.fhp files which use it.  If you want to change the stylesheet now,
all pages will use the new stylesheet.  This makes maintaining HTML
pages much easier. 2002 version, alpha, based on m4.
