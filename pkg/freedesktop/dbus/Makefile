DESCRIPTION =  dbus communicates among processes
define BLURB 
D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications
to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus
helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to
code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications
and daemons on demand when their services are needed.
