GARVERSION = 15.0
HOME_URL = https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/
DESCRIPTION = pulseaudio
define BLURB
PulseAudio is a sound system for POSIX OSes, meaning that it is a proxy
for your sound applications. It allows you to do advanced operations on
your sound data as it passes between your application and your hardware,
such as transferring the audio to a different machine, changing the
sample format or channel count and mixing several sounds into one.
