DESCRIPTION = GNUstep music file player
define BLURB 
Cynthiune is a free-software and romantic music player for GNUstep (and
unmentionable non-free o.s.es), able to play a lot of different audio
formats. The author, Wolfgang Sourdeau, wrote it originally as a Christmas
gift to a girl that he liked because she could not listen to music on
her XXX computer with a free program.
