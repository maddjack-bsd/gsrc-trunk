StepSync allows keeping two folders synchronized, it can be thus used as
a back-up utility.  StepSync manages two trees, starting from a folder
as root and recursing in them.  StepSync determines which files were
added or removed or changed; then it allows, distinctly, to insert new
files, to update or delete. It allows also to apply changes from target
to source.
