DESCRIPTION = GNUstep application for database access for salesforce
define BLURB
DataBasin is a tool to access and work with SalesForce.com. (Not an
endorsement.) It allows one to perform queries remotely, export and
import data.   DataBasin uses the WebServices exposed by the SFDC API and
exposes them as methods of the DBSoap class.  To send and receive the SOAP
messages, DB uses the websevices (GSWS) available from GNUstep libraries
and which is a mandatory requisite.  Access to the SFDC API is provided
by the framework DataBasinKit.
