GARNAME = Addresses
GARVERSION = 0.4.8
HOME_URL = http://www.non-gnu.org/gap/addresses/
DESCRIPTION = GNUstep GUI Address book
define BLURB
Addresses for GNUstep is a versatile address book application for managing
contact information. It stores addresses, phone numbers, pictures, instant
messaging information, email, homepages and whatever.  Addresses is also
a framework that allows access to the addresses database in a way that
is sourcecode-compatible with Apple s AddressBook.framework. It also
contains a view framework to facilitate the construction of applications
that use the contact database. Package and Framework is called
"Addresses", but the executable is "AddressManager" for some reason,
one hopes.
