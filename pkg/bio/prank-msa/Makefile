DESCRIPTION = A probabilistic multiple alignment program
define BLURB
PRANK is a probabilistic multiple alignment program that can work with
DNA, codon or amino-acid sequences.  Unlike many alignment programs,
it handles insertions correctly and it avoids over-estimation of the
number of deletion events.  It also supports including potential
structural information to which sequences can be aligned, assisting in
the prediction of locations of structural features in the sequences.
