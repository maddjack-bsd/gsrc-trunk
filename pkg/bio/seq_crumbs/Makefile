NAME = Seq Crumbs
GARNAME = seq_crumbs
UPSTREAMNAME = seq_crumbs
GARVERSION = 0.1.9
HOME_URL = http://bioinf.comav.upv.es/seq_crumbs/
DESCRIPTION = A set of small sequence processing utilities.
define BLURB
Seq_crumbs is modeled after the Unix command line text processing
utilities so every utility tries to perform a specific task and most
of them take a sequence file as input and create a new processed
sequence file as output. This design encourages the assembly of the
seq_crumbs utilities with Unix pipes to create complex pipelines.
