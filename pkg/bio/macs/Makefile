DESCRIPTION = Model-based analysis for ChIP-Seq
define BLURB
MACS is a program for predicting protein-DNA interactions from ChIP-
Seq data.  It works via a model-based analysis that empirically models
the length of the sequence fragments in order to improve the spatial
resolution of predicted binding sites.
