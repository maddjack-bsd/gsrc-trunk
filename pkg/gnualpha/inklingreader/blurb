GNU project to create a free/libre version of the Wacom Inkling
SketchManager. Instead of integrating with proprietary programs,
this program aims to be compatible with free software alternatives
like Inkscape.  It can  display and merge WPI files, export to Inkscape
SVG (preserving layers), PDF, PNG and JSON,  convert all WPI files in a
directory to SVG, automatically use different colors when the "new layer"
is pressed multiple times,  give control over stroke pressure,  export
timing information in JSON, interact with the timeline of your drawing.
There is an Inkscape extension available that allows you to open WPI
files with Inkscape "directly".
