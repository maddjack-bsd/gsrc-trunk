DESCRIPTION =  framework for modeling build software-build pipelines 
define BLURB
BuildStream is a flexible and extensible framework for the modelling
of build pipelines in a declarative YAML format, written in python.
These pipelines are composed of abstract elements which perform mutations
on on "filesystem data" as input and output, and are related to each other
by their dependencies. Datafiles available for GNOME allow building all
of GNOME; might be better than GSRC for building GNOME.
